## Project overview
lulu alerts makes sure consumers don't miss out on purchasing their favorite lululemon products as soon as they go on sale or come back in stock with notifications delivered to their inboxes 

### Description
lulu alerts is a web application for creating and managing alerts for lululemon products under a lulu alerts accounts. Users can configure two different types of alerts: (1) "back in stock" alerts, which tell a user when a particular product that is currently out of stock on lululemon.com shows back up on the website as in stock, as well as (2) "price drop" alerts, which tell a user when a particular product has fallen in price.  On an ongoing basis, the app checks lululemon.com to see if any of its user's configured alerts should be triggered by a particular product price change or product back in stock, and notifies users via email for any triggered alerts.
