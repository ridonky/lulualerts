## Project overview
lulu alerts makes sure shoppers don't miss out on purchasing their favorite lululemon products as soon as they go on sale or come back in stock with notifications delivered to their inboxes 

### Description
lulu alerts is a web application for creating and managing alerts for lululemon products.  Users create lulu alerts accounts, then they can configure two different types of alerts: (1) "back in stock" alerts, which tell a user when a particular out of stock product shows back up on in stock on lululemon.com, as well as (2) "price drop" alerts, which tell a user when a particular product has fallen in price.  On an ongoing basis, the app checks lululemon.com to see if any of its user's configured alerts should be triggered by a particular product price change or product back in stock, and notifies them via email.
